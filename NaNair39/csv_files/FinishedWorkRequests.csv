VB01,Make the nuclear reactor subcritical,Svalbard - Norway,AA999-1,The OK-650VV nuclear reactors were designed around 1970. They tend to overheat if they are not taken care of properly. Regularly (at least once a week) a small amount of boron is needed in the system. NOTE! This requires a contractor who has a good rubber (protective) suit because it is all rather wet and hot and of course it is good to know that he knows what heÂ´s doing. ,Jacob Yxa,2,y,weekly,03.12.2021,06.12.2021
